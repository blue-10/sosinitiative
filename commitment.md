# SOS Commitment

We as a company building SaaS are heavily reliant on and invested in Open Source. We cannot just be consumers and expect premium support from passionate individuals. We have a responsibility to make the world a bit better.

## Benefits of open source
Open source is vital to our business. We build our software on top of the work of community heroes. The work shared by companies and individuals allows us to focus on our core business without having to reinvent the wheel.

## Commitment
We will stimulate all efforts creating a healthy culture towards the use and contribution of OSS by:

- Sharing our code as open source as long it is not considered core business and has no security risk.
- Let our developers contribute code and documentation to relevant projects during business hours.
- Share our learnings with the world. Through talks, blogs, events and other educational content.
- Teach our developers to communicate with maintainers respectfully.
- Not forcing our own agendas.
- Take responsibility for consuming open source projects and to vet our dependencies.
- Sponsor projects and maintainers that are crucial for our business.

## Gotchas
Ownership of intellectual property may come into question. (Software patents, licenses, other IP)

- Our code and documentation quality standard will improve. 
- Flaws and defects are detected earlier and solutions can be crowd-sourced
- By contributing, you improve the health of your dependencies.
- You stand on the shoulders of giants.
